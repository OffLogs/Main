## Applications

### General information

OffLogs saves all received information within Applications. It means,
that before sending information, you need to create an application in the administration panel

### How it works?

1. In [admin panel](/dashboard/applications) you need to create an application.
2. For each application, a **Token** is created, which is used when sending information (logs) to the API located at https://api.offlogs.com
3. After the information has been sent by your system, you can view it in the [dashboard](/dashboard/logs)
